# Recommended Products
Recommended Products module for TarJay e-commerce app

On load, this repository opens some sample data for recommended products for the TarJay web app. When running through the included Express server and properly seeded with data, it will query a MongoDB database (created through the Mongoose ODM) for specific product departments.

To properly start up this service, run the following commands from the root directory:
- `npm install`
- `npm run seed`

These commands should be run from their own terminals to render the app and spin up the service:
- `npm run build`
- `npm start`

To run the provided tests using Jest, use the following command from its own terminal:
- `npm test`

Note: continuous integration has been implemented with CircleCI. Any pull requests to the master branch will be tested.
